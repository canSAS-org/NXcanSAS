<span id="motivationsfornexus"></span><h1>Motivations for the NeXus standard in the Scientific Community<a class="headerlink" href="#motivations-for-the-nexus-standard-in-the-scientific-community" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<span class="target" id="index-0"></span><p>By the early 1990s, several groups of scientists in the fields of neutron and
X-ray science had recognized a common and troublesome pattern in the data acquired
at various scientific instruments and user facilities.  Each of these instruments
and facilities had a locally defined format for recording experimental data.
With lots of different formats, much of the scientists&#8217; time was being wasted in
the task of writing import readers for processing and analysis programs.
As is common, the exact information to be documented from each instrument in a
data file evolves, such as the implementation of new high-throughput detectors.
Many of these formats lacked the generality to extend to the
new data to be stored, thus another new format was devised.  In such environments,
the documentation of each generation of data format is often lacking.</p>
<p>Three parallel developments have led to NeXus:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><em>June 1994</em>:
<span class="target" id="index-1"></span>Mark Könnecke (Paul Scherer Institute, Switzerland) made a
proposal using netCDF for the European neutron scattering
community while working at the ISIS pulsed neutron facility.</li>
<li><em>August 1994</em>:
<span class="target" id="index-2"></span>Jon Tischler and
<span class="target" id="index-3"></span>Mitch Nelson (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA)
proposed an HDF-based format as a standard for data storage at the
Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, USA).</li>
<li><em>October 1996</em>:
<span class="target" id="index-4"></span>Przemek Klosowski
(National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA)
produced a first draft of the NeXus proposal drawing on ideas
from both sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>These scientists proposed methods to store data using
a self-describing, extensible format that was already in broad use
in other scientific disciplines.
Their proposals formed the basis for the current design of the NeXus
standard which was developed across three workshops organized by Ray Osborn (ANL),
<em>SoftNeSS&#8216;94</em> (Argonne Oct. 1994),
<em>SoftNeSS&#8216;95</em> (NIST Sept. 1995),
and <em>SoftNeSS&#8216;96</em> (Argonne Oct. 1996),
attended by representatives
of a range of neutron and X-ray facilities.
The NeXus API was released in late 1997.
Basic motivations for this standard were:</p>

</ol>
<div class="section" id="simple-plotting">
<span id="simpleplotting"></span><h2>Simple plotting<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-plotting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-5">An important motivation for the design of NeXus was to simplify the creation
of a default plot view.
While the best representation of a set of observations will vary,
depending on various conditions, a good suggestion is often known <em>a
priori</em>. This suggestion is described in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NXdata</span></tt>
element so that any program that is used to browse NeXus data files can provide a
<em>best representation</em> without request for user input.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unified-format-for-reduction-and-analysis">
<span id="unifiedformat"></span><h2>Unified format for reduction and analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#unified-format-for-reduction-and-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-6">Another important motivation for NeXus, indeed the <em>raison
d&#8217;etre</em>, was the community need to analyze data from different user
facilities. A single data format that is in use at a variety of facilities
would provide a major benefit to the scientific community.
This  should
be capable of describing any type of data from the scientific experiments,
at any step of the process from data acquisition to data reduction and analysis.
This unified format also needs to allow data to be written to storage
as efficiently as possible to enable use with high-speed data acquisition.</p>
<p><em>Self-description</em>, combined with a reliance on a
<em>multi-platform</em> (and thereby <em>portable</em>) data
storage format, are valued components of a data storage format where the longevity of
the data is expected to be longer than the lifetime of the facility at which it is
acquired. As the name implies, self-description within data files is the practice where
the structure of the information contained within the file is evident from the file
itself. A multi-platform data storage format must faithfully represent the data
identically on a variety of computer systems, regardless of the bit order or byte order
or word size native to the computer.</p>
<p>The scientific community continues to grow the various types of data to be expressed
in data files. This practice is expected to continue as part of the investigative
process. To gain broad acceptance in the scientific user community, any data storage
format proposed as a standard would need to be
<em>extendable</em> and continue to provide a means to express the
latest notions of scientific data.</p>
<p>The maintenance cost of common data structures meeting the motivations above
(self-describing, portable, and extendable) is not insurmountable but is often
well-beyond the research funding of individual members of the muon, neutron, and X-ray
science communities. Since it is these members that drive the selection of a data
storage format, it is necessary for the user cost to be as minimal as possible. In this
case, experience has shown that the format must be in the
<em>public-domain</em> for it to be commonly accepted as a standard. A
benefit of the public-domain aspect is that the source code for the API is open and
accessible, a point which has received notable comment in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>More recently, NeXus has recognized that part of the scientific community with a
desire to write and record scientific data, has small data volumes and a large aversion
to the requirement of a complicated API necessary to access data in binary files such as
HDF. For such information, the NeXus API (<span class="target" id="index-7"></span>NAPI) has been extended by the
addition of the eXtensible Markup Language (<span class="target" id="index-8"></span>XML) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>  as an
alternative to HDF. XML is a text-based format that supports
compression and structured data and has broad usage in business and e-commerce. While
possibly complicated, XML files are human readable, and tools for translation and
extraction are plentiful. The API has routines to read and write XML data and to convert
between HDF and XML.</p>

<span id="commonexchangeformat"></span><h3>NeXus as a Common Data Exchange Format<a class="headerlink" href="#nexus-as-a-common-data-exchange-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p id="index-9">By the late 1980s, it had become common practice for a scientific instrument
or facility to define its own data format, often at the convenience of the local
computer system. Data from these facilities were not easily interchanged due to various
differences in computer systems and the compression schemes of binary data. It was
necessary to contact the facility to obtain a description so that one could write an
import routine in software. Experience with facilities closing (and subsequent lack of
access to information describing the facility data format) revealed a significant
limitation with this common practice.  Further, there existed a
<em>N * N</em> number of conversion routines necessary to convert
data between various formats.
In <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-data-pre-nexus"><em>N separate file formats</em></a>, circles represent different
data file formats while arrows represent conversion routines.  Note that
the red circle only maps to one other format.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>N</em> separate file formats</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>One early idea has been for NeXus to become the common data exchange format,
and thereby reduce the number of data conversion routines from
<em>N * N</em> down to <em>2N</em>, as show in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-data-post-nexus"><em>N separate file formats joined by a common NeXus converter</em></a>.</p>

<span id="defineddictionary"></span><h2>Defined dictionary of terms<a class="headerlink" href="#defined-dictionary-of-terms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-10">A necessary feature of a standard for the interchange of scientific data is
a ` <em>defined dictionary</em> (or <em>lexicography</em>) of
terms. This dictionary declares the expected spelling and meaning of terms when they are
present so that it is not necessary to search for all the variant forms of
<em>energy</em> when it is used to describe data (e.g., <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">E</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">e</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keV</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eV</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nrg</span></tt>, ...).</p>
<p>NeXus recognized that each scientific specialty has developed a unique dictionary and
needs to categorize data using those terms. The NeXus Application Definitions provide
the means to document the lexicography for use in data files of that scientific
specialty.</p>
