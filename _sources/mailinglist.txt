NeXus Mailing List
=======================

We invite anyone who is associated with neutron and/or X-ray
synchrotron science and who wishes to be involved in the
development and testing of the NeXus format to subscribe to
this list. It is for the free discussion of all aspects of the
design and operation of the NeXus format.

.. _NeXus.mailinglist.niac:

NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC) Mailing List
===============================================================

This list contains discussions of the :ref:`NIAC`,
which oversees the development of the NeXus data format.
Its members represent many of the major neutron and synchrotron
scattering sources in the world. Membership and posting to this list
are limited to the committee members, but the archives are public.

.. _NeXus.mailinglist.Developers:

NeXus Developers Mailing List (retired)
========================================

This mailing list was for discussions concerning the technical
development of NeXus (the Definitions, NXDL, and
the NeXus Application Program Interface). There was, however, much 
overlap with the general NeXus mailing list and so this separate list was 
closed in October 2012, but the archive of previous posting is still available. 

.. closed for new contributions per NIAC 2012
